# About

The raw data of this project comes from Samsung Galaxy S smartphones, in
which accelerometer technologhy is used to record various activities
like walking and standing. The objective of this group project is to
work effectively with a raw data, cleaning and preparing it for further
analysis. In doing this, we merged datasets, extracted targeted
measurements and data points, applied descriptive labels, and finalized
a tidy dataset.


# Contents

- **`GroupWork.R`** – The R script that performs all data loading and merging,
  cleaning, extraction, and renaming. The R Script also creates a tidy dataset to be used for future analysis. 
- **`tidy_dataset.txt`** – The final tidy dataset, complete with the average values
  per activity and subject. 
- **`CodeBook.md`** – A markdown file that details data overview, variable and measurement descriptions, as well as instructions for code implementation.
- **`ReadMe.md`** – A markdown file that provides a summary of the project.

# How to run the Script

1.  Download and unzip the UCI HAR dataset into a folder.
2.  Run `GroupWork.R` in RStudio.
3.  The script will create `tidy_dataset.txt`.
