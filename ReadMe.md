# About the Project 

The raw data of this project comes from Samsung Galaxy S smartphones, in which accelerometer and gyroscope technologhy was used to record various activities, including walking and standing. The dataset was dowloaded from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. 
The objective of this group project is to work effectively with a raw dataset, cleaning and preparing it for further analysis. In doing this, we merged datasets, extracted targeted measurements and data points, and worked with variable names to apply descriptive labels. The final product is a tidy dataset that is easily readable and ready to be used for future analysis. 


# Contents

- **`GroupWork.R`** – The R script that performs all data loading and merging,
  cleaning, extraction, and variable renaming. The R Script outputs a tidy dataset to be used for future analysis. 
- **`tidy_dataset.txt`** – The final tidy dataset, complete with the average values per activity and subject. 
- **`CodeBook.md`** – A markdown file that details data overview, variable and measurement descriptions, as well as instructions for code implementation.
- **`ReadMe.md`** – A markdown file that provides context and a summary of the project.

# How to run the Script

1.  Download and unzip the UCI HAR dataset into a folder.
2.  Download `GroupWork.R`.
3.  Run `GroupWork.R` in RStudio.
4.  The script will create `tidy_dataset.txt`.
